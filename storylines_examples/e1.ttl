France.
1975.

You are stood in a field, surrounded by barley as far as the eye can see.
But your nose detects something else. As the golden crops sway in the breeze you notice a scent in the damp air.

It is a vaguely metallic odour. 
It reminds you of something.

Could it be [[blood->Intro 6]]?
Or maybe the smell of [[rust->Intro 7]]?'

When the Imperial War Museum in London launched it's 'Trench Experience' in 1990, it offered a recreation of a section of trench complete with the smells of cordite, frying bacon, and lyddite from discharged shells. 

The veteran Tommy Keele, aged 96 at the time the museum opened its new exhibition, mused that 'I thought I was back'. But there were limits to how far these scents could really evoke his experience. He added:

'Waterloo and its surrounding countryside had been characterised by the smells of war long before the fateful battle in June 1815.
Situated between Brussels to the north and Namur to the south, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had seen the area criss-crossed by armies.
The movemment of men and arms across the Belgian countryside was accompanied by a varied smellscape. In 1692, as the French entered Dinant, they were welcomed by evening prayers at the church and, as one soldier described it,

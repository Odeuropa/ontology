* The preferred prefix is ```od```
* The associated namespace of the ontology is ```<http://data.odeuropa.eu/ontology/>```

The ontology has been edited on [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/) and available in the [Turtle format](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/)

The model re-uses and extends established ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM, in order to represent the relevant information as a set of interconnected events.
The ontology makes use of the following namespaces:
* ```crm``` pointing to ```<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/>``` (see [github](https://github.com/erlangen-crm/ecrm))
* ```crmsci``` pointing to ```<http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/CRMsci/>```
